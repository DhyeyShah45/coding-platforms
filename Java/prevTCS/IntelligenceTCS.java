/**
 * An intelligence agency has received reports about some threats. The reports consist of numbers in a mysterious method. There is a number �N� and another number �R�. Those numbers are studied thoroughly and it is concluded that all digits of the number �N� are summed up and this action is performed �R� number of times. The resultant is also a single digit that is yet to be deciphered. The task here is to find the single-digit sum of the given number �N� by repeating the action �R� number of times.
If the value of �R� is 0, print the output as �0�.

Example 1:
Input :
99 -> Value of N
3  -> Value of R

Output :
9  -> Possible ways to fill the cistern.

Explanation:
Here, the number N=99
Sum of the digits N: 9+9 = 18
Repeat step 2 �R� times i.e. 3 tims  (9+9)+(9+9)+(9+9) = 18+18+18 =54
Add digits of 54 as we need a single digit 5+4

Hence , the output is 9.

Example 2:
Input :
1234   -> Value of N
2      -> Value of R

Output :
2  -> Possible ways to fill the cistern

Explanation:
Here, the number N=1234
Sum of the digits of N: 1+2+3+4 =10
Repeat step 2 �R� times i.e. 2 times  (1+2+3+4)+(1+2+3+4)= 10+10=20
Add digits of 20 as we need a single digit. 2+0=2
Hence, the output is 2.

Constraints:
0<N<=1000
0<=R<=50

The Input format for testing 
The candidate has to write the code to accept 2 input(s)
First input- Accept value for N (positive integer number)
Second input: Accept value for R(Positive integer number)

The output format for testing 
The output should be a positive integer number or print the message (if any) given in the problem statement. (Check the output in Example 1, Example 2).
